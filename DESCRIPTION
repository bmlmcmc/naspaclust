Description: Implementing the improvement of Spatial Clustering using Fuzzy Geographically Weighted Clustering (FGWC) with various optimization algorithm, mainly from Xin-She Yang (2014) Nature-Inspired Optimization Algorithms book. The optimization algorithm is useful to tackle the disadvantages of clustering inconsistency when using the traditional approach. The distance measurements option is also provided in order to increase the quality of clustering results. The FGWC using nature inspired optimisation algorithm was developed by G. A. Mason and R. D. Jacobson (2007) and the optimisation approach of fuzzy clustering was developed by T. A. Runkler and C. Katz (2006) <doi: 10.1109/fuzzy.2006.1681773>.
